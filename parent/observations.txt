RandomAlgorithm:
Has an average score of around 5800-5900 (7 routes)
much overlap and doesnt use all connections
Goes back and forth a lot
Creating 7 routes gives the highest average score, and the highest tail, 
so this is a possible heuristiek

Greedy:
Average score of around 6100-6200, so a little bit better
Longer routes
Still much overlap, doesnt use all connections
